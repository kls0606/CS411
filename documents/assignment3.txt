A document explaining why you chose the technology stack that you are demonstrating; 
Iâ€™d like to know if you considered other stacks, and the process you used to choose the stack for the prototype.


Technology Stack

Client Side:
Usage of Jinja to render into HTML template.

Server Side:
Web Framework : Flask
Programming Language : Python 
Database: SQLAlchemy

Python is choosen because python is a language very easy to work with, do not have the time within the semester to learn a completely new language such as javascript
