1.) As a college student in Boston, I want to connect my Facebook profile to see if any of my mutual friends are also on the app and eat with friends that have similar food interests as me. I also want to be able to customize my profile with food interests, budget, and good restrictions.


2.) As a busy person, I want to eat a certain type of food during my break, but do not want to eat alone, so I log onto the app to find good matching restaurant to eat with others.


3.) As a college student, I want to meet new friends especially those who share similar schedules with me so that we could eat together after class.


5.)  As a hungry user , I want to be able to see appetizing images of food options as I log onto the app so that I can quickly find where to and whom with to eat.
